The code in this respository was developed while working on my thesis.
My thesis looks at finding the lower and upper bounds of a function called the minimum edge sum.
The edge sum is another function that checks for summation of all the weights of the edges in the taxicab metric for a specific embedding of a graph.
A upper bound for the minimum edge sum for a graph G is the edge sum of an embedding of G. 
The code in the resposity runs the edge sum function on images of graphs embedded into the grid.

I suggest building graphs using a software like 3D paint or Tiled. I have plans to create another version of this code that is independent of image files.
I have also included the reference tiles.
